# Alfredo's `codespark`
CodeSpark can be defined as a repository or collection of essential scripts, configurations, and templates designed to ignite and streamline the development and automation of various processes. This resource would serve as a catalyst for setting up and managing tools and technologies such as Terraform, Packer, Ansible, Docker Compose, and more.


**Howdy!**

**I’m Alfredo, a DevSecOps Engineer with a passion for developing and implementing effective security strategies, building strong teams, and safeguarding company information..**

Welcome to CodeSpark, my personal collection of templates. Within this repository, you’ll discover a variety of templates and configurations for different tools and technologies.

> :warning: Please note, tools and technologies evolve over time. I strive to keep everything up to date with the latest changes and releases, but there might be occasions where this isn't possible.

These resources are provided for free to support your specific projects.
