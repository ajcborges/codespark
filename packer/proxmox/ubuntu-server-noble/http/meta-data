meta-data

# This file is part of the Packer template located in the ./http/ directory.

# The 'meta-data' file is typically used to define instance metadata
# when creating images with Packer. Instance metadata can include
# information like the instance ID, hostname, and other custom metadata
# that might be required for your build process.

# Example usage:
# You might include key-value pairs in this file to provide necessary
# configuration details that need to be baked into the machine image.

# Currently, this file is empty. To use it, add your metadata in the format:
# key1: value1
# key2: value2
# ...

# For more information, refer to the Packer documentation:
# https://www.packer.io/docs
```
